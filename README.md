Shipping Quote Bot
A Slack bot that automates shipping quote requests by parsing workflow submissions, calculating package weights based on device types, fetching real-time carrier rates from the ShipStation API, and posting formatted quotes back to the requesting user in-thread.

How It Works
A team member submits a shipping quote request through a Slack Workflow Builder form
The bot monitors a designated channel for incoming workflow submissions
It parses the request to extract device details, shipping zip code, and shipping method
Package weight is calculated based on device type:
Smart Labels / ECO1: 0.125 lbs per device
All other devices: 1.5 lbs per device
Mixed orders are supported (e.g., "10 smart labels, 4 ECO1, 5 voyagers")
The bot calls the ShipStation API to get a real-time shipping rate
A formatted quote is posted back in the message thread, tagging the original requester

Exception Handling
International orders — Non-US zip codes are detected automatically. The bot tags the fulfillment team user group for manual assistance instead of generating a quote.
Overweight shipments — Orders exceeding 50 lbs are flagged and routed to the fulfillment team.

Project Structure

   bot.py                 # Main bot application
   
   Dockerfile             # Container image definition
   
   docker-compose.yml     # Service orchestration
   
   requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
   
   .env                   # Environment variables (not tracked)
   
   .gitignore             # Git ignore rules


Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root with the following:

SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token

SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret

SHIPSTATION_API_KEY=your-shipstation-api-key

SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET=your-shipstation-api-secret

PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

Note: Never commit your .env file. It is excluded via .gitignore.


Slack App Configuration
The bot requires the following OAuth scopes under Bot Token Scopes:

channels:history — Read messages in public channels

channels:read — View basic channel info

chat:write — Post messages

groups:history — Read messages in private channels

usergroups:read — Read user group info

usergroups:write — Mention user groups in messages

After adding scopes, reinstall the app to your workspace.


Setup & Deployment
Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shipping-bot.git
   cd shipping-bot
   
Create your .env file with the required environment variables listed above.
Build and start the bot:
   docker-compose up -d --build
   
Verify the bot is running:
   docker-compose logs -f
   
You should see ⚡️ Bolt app is running! in the output.

Updating
After making changes to bot.py:
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
